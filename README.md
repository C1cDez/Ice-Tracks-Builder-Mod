# Ice-Tracks-Builder-Mod
Mod that I created for my video about Bezier Curves

This mod builds Ice Tracks for Boats Races



Using:

/track new [name] - Creates new Reference of Track



/track point add [trackName] [coordinates] - Adds node to Track



/track height [trackName] [Y-coordinate] - Sets Y-coordinate for Track

/track radius [trackName] [radius] - Sets Width of a Track



/track setQ0 [trackName] [coordinates] - Sets special Q0 point (need for math)



/track build [name] - Builds TrackÂ  (MAY CAUSE SEVERE LAGS)

/track destroy [name] - Destroys Track
